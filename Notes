To Do:
When the projection is done into the global frame, make sure it isn't in parallel with
Finish the joint angle approximation process
Clean up code
Documentation

Notes:
Do we need to zero out the accelerometer data? This could be a problem if the offsets are different?


Completed:
Data Preprocessing:
-Offset
-Resample
-Low pass filter
-Gdot calculation

gdot is currently just at a first order approximation. This should be improved
